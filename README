README for PlateProject

Instructions:
- A windows executable will be available soon. (hopefully a GUI too)

- In the meantime, here is how to run it using a python installation
1) open a terminal in the PlateProj/python directory (or navigate there)
2) type 'python PlateProj.py <file1> <file2> ... <fileN>'
3) where <fileX> is replaced by the names of the xmlfiles you want to convert. You can do single files or multiple files at the same time.
4) the output will be saved as .csv files in the same directory as the .xml files.
